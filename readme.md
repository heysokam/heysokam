Are you looking for one of my repos?  
Replace `github.com` in the URL you are trying to access with `codeberg.org`.  
_eg: `github.com/heysokam/reponame` becomes `codeberg.org/heysokam/reponame`_  

## Summary
Microsoft:
> Lets not replace GitHub's CEO after [he leaves the company](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/),  
> and [lets merge the entire GitHub team into the **CodeAI** subdivision](https://devops.com/github-ceo-to-step-down-as-company-is-more-tightly-embraced-by-microsofts-coreai-team/).  

Me:
> Wait, what?... What did you just merge? What the hell?  
> 🤦 Let me move all my repos [out of GitHub](https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/what-is-codeberg/).  

## Explanation
The AI gold fever will make you believe that "AI is the future, bro!".  
But I personally believe that the world is becoming much much worse overall.  
Full of lies and deception, all in the name of some paper money that doesn't even exist.  

As such, I don't want to be a contributor, in any way,  
to the AI enshittification that is rampant in this age of technology.  

Some more food for thought:  
[Give Up GitHub: by the SFC](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/)  

I don't know if I agree with their points or not.  
But it doesn't matter.  
Companies getting absorbed by bigger companies,  
and quickly becoming shittier and shittier until they die,  
[is not something new to the AI craze at all](https://youtu.be/YXrb-DqsBNU?si=H3WqdHBVa_ViUoV0&t=1186).
